## Developer Notes / Desired Additions
 * _Ideally there would be additional sections to showcase my lighting cv a little more. What that means is I hope to add a bunch of my lighting paperwork and pictures of previous shows I've done. This would expand upon my resume section._
 * _It'd be cool to add a gallery type function for said lighting paperwork, I haven't researched it yet but should be relatively easy to implement_
 * _the pictures of my face on the buttons and the picture of me in the bathtub are placeholders. They'll be replaced with more professional photos_
 * _The about me section as well as the outside work section are pretty superflous to the intention of the portfolio. Maybe I can find a way to incorporate that information in a more intentional way_
